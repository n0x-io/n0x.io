      <description>Hello World! Again!    Hey there! It’s me again.
It has been some time since I wrote a new article in here so I thought I’d state an update on me. In my first post I talked a little about me. By now some time went by and some things have changed - not that I wrote much about me to begin with.
From full time job to becoming a student    I’m now 23 years old and just started my 4th semester at university after deciding that I wanted to study something computer science related.</description>

      <description>A Git-Server Setup In Minutes    Sometimes I wish I had other hobbies then just trying out new stuff I discovered online.
For Some strange reason I felt the need to set up my own git server - because who doesn&amp;rsquo;t need an own server for the two or three projects you keep on github? I looked around and searched for some solutions that would fit my needs.</description>

      <description>Reverse Shell for 1,50€ - Digispark instead of USB Rubber Ducky    Some of you might already have heard of it: The USB Rubber Ducky by Hak5. A very special USB-Device: Not only a mass storage device but any usb input-device you want it to be. Because of this you can use it for some very nice ways to get your payload onto a victims PC. The Rubber Ducky is freely programmable so there are no limits on what you can do with it.</description>
